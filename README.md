# Text-to-handwriting

It is a simple program that converts text to handwritten text.


## Description:
The program aims at helping all those people who don’t have time to manually
write a piece of text but need one, people who don’t have a good handwriting and
want a text written in good readable handwriting and people who need
handwritten text for any other reason.

The program aims to provide a good amount of handwriting options and provide
accurate results.

Through this project I want to help anyone who struggles to write handwritten text
and make their life slightly easy.

## Libraries Needed:
1. tkinter
2. PIL
3. pytesseract
4. textwrap
